# Alexandra Davenport

### Milestone Project One

Alexandra Davenport is a London based artist working primarily with performance, photography and text. 
She already has a basic [wordpress site](https://alexdavenport.com/), which shows examples of her work, collaborations and 
publications but she struggles to maintain and style this as many artists do. 

Since 2018 Alexandra has been lecturing at the Arts University Bournemouth and with this new direction would 
like a cleaner, more professional looking website so she can share her journey with others.

## UX

### Strategy
The aim is to improve the current site by streamlining the existing model; removing irrelevant information and sections 
to find a balance between an artistic / professional aesthetic and feel.

### Reasons for the site
* Self-promotion.
* To show her portfolio / body of work to others.
* To help people get in touch with her.

### User Stories
* I’m a curator who is planning an upcoming exhibition and I’ve been pointed towards Alex - 
I’d now like to see some examples of her work. I’d also like to find out abit about her and see what other exhibitions 
she has been involved in. I like what I see and want to get in touch with her to discuss my upcoming exhibition.

* I’m a student who is taught by Alex. As an aspiring artist I’d like to see her work and use this as inspiration for my 
upcoming projects. I spend a lot of time on social media and I’d like to follow Alex on Instagram as I like her work. 
I can also use her posts as research for my university work and keep an eye out for upcoming shows and exhibitions.

* I’ve recently seen some of Alex’s work at a gallery and would like to see more. I’d like to informed of upcoming projects, 
exhibitions and news so follow her on social media and also subscribe to a mailing list.

### Scope - Functionality
* The site must be easy to navigate around.
* Unlike most artist's website it must be well presented and visually appealing.
* Be minimalistic and reflect her work.
* Function as it should.

### Scope - Content
As we are using this site to self-promote we need to meet these requirements:
* Tell the audience who we are and what we do.
* Show the audience our work.
* List where we are showing work and where we’ve shown work.
* Show features in the press we’ve had.
* Make it easy to get in touch by email, social media or contact form.

I want the work section to be more like an online portfolio, with each project deserving of having a page to itself 
talking about the project in more detail and showing more images, videos and sketches but in more structured and user 
friendly way then currently shown on Alex’s existing wordpress site.

Alex has selected 12 projects that she’d like to continue displaying – meaning an additional 12 pages, which isn’t feasible 
or necessary at this time. We can keep this to one page for the time being and show an image that represents each project 
with the intention of this section of the site evolving over time. This would lead us to adding more pages (a page for each 
project) in the future, which will add more content and context to each project and the current work page acting as a 
visual contents page, linking to each of these project pages.

### Structure
Based on the content required in the scope this website will consist of 4 pages:
* A home / landing page, which will feature an image of Alex’s work.
* An about page, telling the user about Alex’s work and her work / exhibition history.
* Work page – as touched upon in the scope will show examples of Alex’s work with the view of extending this over time.
* Contact (contact form).

The site will have navigational links in the sidebar (on desktops) and in the header and footer (on tablet and mobile 
devices), which will feature on each page. Not only will this create a better space for displaying information in my 
opinion but meaning the site will be easy to navigate around whilst the user will have access to her Instagram, the option 
to email Alex and to subscribe to her newsletter (via mailchimp) at any point.

### Surface
I’ve spoken about creating balance between an artistic and professional aesthetic throughout this site, implementing a 
minimalistic feel which I feel is suited to a website of this kind. 

Aesthetically I’ve liked the idea of a fixed side bar from the get go so I plan on having this on every page with links 
to the other pages on here. A logo and a footer containing social media links will also feature at the top and bottom of 
this side bar meaning you can access any page or contact details quickly and from any other page on the site. This side bar 
will collapse to a drop down menu in the header with the social links remaining at the foot of the page on smaller devices.

In keeping which my minimalistic approach I’ve chosen to use two colours that contrast one another and will use these 
throughout - #FAFAFA (white) and #366788 (blue), which I found using ColorHunt. A lot of the images I plan on using are 
light in colour – so the white complements these whilst the blue offers a contrast where needed. I’m also planning on using 
the google font “Inter”, which is a sans-serif font – similar to what she uses now. This imported google font along with 
the use of letter spacing in my css will help me achieve this professional and artistic look. 

The imagery used throughout this site will be a reflection on Alex herself being a photographer / artist first and foremost. 
The background of the home / landing page will be a full size image of Alex performing. A large image will also be used 
on the contact page as I feel it’s important to showcase her work where possible – I want the images to do the work really 
and add content and context where applicable. All Imagery will be supplied by Alex.

## Testing

Seperate testing document can be found here - [testing.md](/workspace/MSP1/testing.md)

## Deployment

### Adding and committing files
I’ve been using Gitpod for writing all my code and using the terminal within to add, commit and push my progress from 
my workspace to GitHub where it is stored remotely as shown in the course content. 

1. When I have made a couple of minor additions / changes or one large change or addition I add the file in question 
to the staging area by typing - git add . in the terminal. The “.” will add all new files. To be more selective either 
type in the file name e.g. index.html or the files pathway e.g. assets/css/style.css instead of the fullstop.

2. I need to now save my changes to my a local repository by typing - git commit –m “ ” into the terminal. 
Between the “ ” write a concise message detailing what this commit has done.

3. When I either want to upload all my changes for the day or view my alterations on GitHub Pages I push all the 
commits to GitHub using - git push. When GitHub Pages is set up for the repository it will automatically pick up these 
changes.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Once logged into github I navigated to my MSP1 repository via "my repositories".
2. Selected settings in the menu at the top of the screen.
3. I scrolled down to the section named "GitHub Pages" near the bottom of the page.
4. Under the title "Source" changed the dropdown to read Branch:master as this is the branch im using.
5. The page refreshed, meaning this was successful. Changes do take a while to take effect.
6. To retrieve the link I had to go back to the GitHub pages section via settings (like in step 3) where it's displayed.

### Cloning
1. Once logged into github I navigate to the repository i wish to clone.
2. Next to the green Gitpod button theres a button that reads code, click this. 
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link with HTTPS selected.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone and then paste the link you selected in step 3 and then press enter.
