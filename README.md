# Alexandra Davenport

Milestone Project One

Alexandra Davenport is a London based artist working primarily with performance, photography and text. 
She already has a basic [wordpress site](https://alexdavenport.com/), which shows examples of her work, collaborations and 
publications but she struggles to maintain and style this as many artists do. 

Since 2018 Alexandra has been lecturing at the Arts University Bournemouth and with this new direction would 
like a cleaner, more professional looking website so she can share her journey with others. 

## UX

### User Stories

* I’m a curator who is planning an upcoming exhibition and I’ve been pointed towards Alex - 
I’d now like to see some examples of her work. I’d also like to find out abit about her and see what other exhibitions 
she has been involved in. I like what I see and want to get in touch with her to discuss my upcoming exhibition.

* I’m a student who is taught by Alex. As an aspiring artist I’d like to see her work and use this as inspiration for my 
upcoming projects. I spend a lot of time on social media and I’d like to follow Alex on Instagram as I like her work. 
I can also use her posts as research for my university work and keep an eye out for upcoming shows and exhibitions.

* I’ve recently seen some of Alex’s work at a gallery and would like to see more. I’d like to informed of upcoming projects, 
exhibitions and news so follow her on social media and also subscribe to a mailing list.

### Strategy
The aim is to improve the current site by streamlining the existing model; removing irrelevant information and sections 
to find a balance between an artistic / professional aesthetic and feel.
