# Alexandra Davenport

Milestone Project One

Alexandra Davenport is a London based artist working primarily with performance, photography and text. 
She already has a basic [wordpress site](https://alexdavenport.com/), which shows examples of her work, collaborations and 
publications but she struggles to maintain and style this as many artists do. 

Since 2018 Alexandra has been lecturing at the Arts University Bournemouth and with this new direction would 
like a cleaner, more professional looking website so she can share her journey with others.

## UX

### User Stories

* I’m a curator who is planning an upcoming exhibition and I’ve been pointed towards Alex - 
I’d now like to see some examples of her work. I’d also like to find out abit about her and see what other exhibitions 
she has been involved in. I like what I see and want to get in touch with her to discuss my upcoming exhibition.

* I’m a student who is taught by Alex. As an aspiring artist I’d like to see her work and use this as inspiration for my 
upcoming projects. I spend a lot of time on social media and I’d like to follow Alex on Instagram as I like her work. 
I can also use her posts as research for my university work and keep an eye out for upcoming shows and exhibitions.

* I’ve recently seen some of Alex’s work at a gallery and would like to see more. I’d like to informed of upcoming projects, 
exhibitions and news so follow her on social media and also subscribe to a mailing list.

### Strategy
The aim is to improve the current site by streamlining the existing model; removing irrelevant information and sections 
to find a balance between an artistic / professional aesthetic and feel.

### Scope
As we are using this site to self-promote we need to meet four requirements:
* Tell the audience who we are and what we do. (About us).
* Show the audience a portfolio of our work. (Work).
* List where we are showing work, where we’ve shown work and any features in the press we’ve had.
* How to get in touch – email, social media or form. (Contact).

The work section should be more expansive then time will allow in this instance, with each project capable of having a page 
to itself talking about the project in more detail and showing more images and video showing making a more complete portfolio. 
We can keep this to one page for the time being and show an image that represents each project with the intention of this 
evolving over time. This would lead us to adding more pages (a page for each project) in the future, which will add more 
content to each project page and the current work page acting as contents page linking to each project page.

### Structure
Aesthetically I’ve liked the idea of a fixed side bar from the get go so I plan on having this on every page with links to 
the other pages on here. A logo and a footer containing social media links will also feature at the top and bottom of this 
side bar meaning you can access any page or contact details quickly and from any other page on the site. This side bar 
will collapse to a drop down menu in the header with the social links remaining at the foot. Both of these will leave a 
void for content, which will be better for all devices in my opinion. The site will contain of four pages, each fulfilling 
each requirement outlined in the scope.

### Surface
I’ve chosen to use two colours that contrast one another and use these throughout - #FAFAFA (white) and #366788 (blue), 
which I found using [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/). A lot of the images used throughout are light in colour – so the 
white complements these whilst the blue offers a contrast where needed.
